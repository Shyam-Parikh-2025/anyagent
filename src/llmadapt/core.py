    `asyncio.run()` would be enough - except that `asyncio.run()` raises

    into a `"Tool Execution Failure (...)"` string, because a tool that
    crashed is ordinarily something the model should see and work around -
    that is the whole reason a bad argument doesn't kill a run.

    A small number of exceptions are not that. They are not "this tool
    failed", they are "this run must stop, or wait". The one that exists today
    is `company.escalation.EscalationUnresolved`: a human was asked whether to
    continue and said no. Because `delegate_to_<name>` is an ordinary tool
    (Employee.delegate_tool), a decline raised inside a delegated employee
    used to be caught by execute() and handed back to the *manager's* model as
    a failed-tool string - so the manager read "that didn't work", tried
    something else, and the run finished normally reporting success. The human
    said stop and nothing stopped, which is the exact inversion of the
    0-means-always-ask-a-human-first rule the budget and escalation systems are
    built on.

    Anything subclassing this is re-raised by execute() rather than
    stringified. It is a base class rather than a hardcoded tuple of types
    inside execute() so that core.py needs no import of the company layer (the
    dependency arrow points one way, see company/employee.py's docstring), and

        This is the line that makes a delegation hierarchy worth having. A

        run one after another they cost the sum of three round-trips, and the
        two reports not currently being waited on sit idle. Here they cost the
        slowest one.

        `return_exceptions=True` is not politeness, it is the difference
        between a sibling failing and a sibling being abandoned: without it,
        gather propagates the first exception immediately while the other
        coroutines are still running, and their results - including any work
        already charged to the budget - are dropped on the floor with nobody
        waiting on them. With it, everyone finishes and then the failures are
        dealt with:

        - a ToolControlFlow (an escalation a human declined, and later a
          pause) is re-raised, because it is a statement about the run rather
          than about one tool, and the run is what has to stop;
        - anything else becomes the same "Tool Execution Failure" string a
          crash inside execute_async() would have produced, so one bad tool
          call is something the model can see and work around, exactly as it
          was when these ran one at a time.

        Ordering is unaffected: gather returns results in the order the
        coroutines were passed, not the order they finished, so writing them
        back against `calls` stays correct.
