"""policy.py - Phase 4: the auto-mode local-vs-API model policy.

`selector.py` + `router.allocate_local_auto()` already rank *local* models
against this machine's real benchmark numbers. What was missing was the layer
above that: given a rank, an optional effort/priority hint, and an optional
specialty, decide whether this employee should run on a local model at all -
and if not, which API model to buy instead.

Three deliberate scope decisions, all per the roadmap:

1. **The API model table is user-supplied config, not a live pricing fetch.**
   `DEFAULT_API_CATALOG` below is a small seed table so the module is useful
   out of the box, but its prices and capability numbers are hand-entered and
   **will go stale** - they are a starting point to edit, not a source of
   truth. Nothing in llmadapt phones home to refresh them (that was flagged
   as a scope trap: pricing pages change shape constantly and it would drag a
   scraper + a cache + a staleness policy into a zero-dependency library).
   Pass your own `ApiModelCatalog` to get numbers you trust.

2. **The effort hint is an input from the start, not a later bolt-on.** Every
   entry point here - `ModelPolicy.decide()`, `Company.hire()`,
   `Company.run()` - takes `effort=` alongside `rank`. It is what moves the
   local-vs-API threshold: "cheap" work stays local if anything local fits at
   all, "effort" work goes to the strongest API model configured.

3. **Effort does NOT silently feed `BudgetLedger.importance`** (roadmap open
   question #1, resolved here). They answer different questions - effort is
   "how capable a model does this need?", importance is "how large a slice of
   the company's token pool does this employee get?". Coupling them
   automatically would quietly redefine what `importance` means in Phase 3's
   ledger and make budget reports impossible to reason about. Instead there
   is an explicit, opt-in bridge - `suggested_importance(effort)` - that a
   caller can pass into `hire(importance=...)` themselves if they *do* want
   the two to move together. Explicit beats implicit here because the ledger
   is the thing standing between this library and a surprise bill.

Everything in this module is a pure decision function over data structures:
no network calls, no model loading. That is what makes it testable offline
(see tests/test_policy.py) and what lets `Company` consult it at hire time
without paying for anything.
