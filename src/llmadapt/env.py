"""env.py - reading API keys out of the environment, and out of a `.env` file,
without a third-party dependency.

Two things were wrong before this module existed.

**The library never read `.env`.** `core.py` resolved a missing key with
`os.getenv(f"{provider.upper()}_API_KEY")`, which reads the *process*
environment only. A `.env` file sitting in the project root - the normal way
people keep a key out of their shell history - was never opened by anything in
`src/`. The only `load_dotenv()` calls were in a test scratchpad and in
`core.py`'s own demo block, and `dotenv` is a third-party package, which has no
business being imported by a library whose first stated convention is zero
third-party dependencies. So the key was there, the code looked like it should
find it, and it didn't.

**One key per provider isn't enough.** It is fine for the big three - one
account, one key, many models - and wrong the moment two endpoints share a
provider *protocol* but not an account. OpenRouter, Together, Groq, Fireworks
and a local vLLM are all `provider="openai"` as far as the transport is
concerned, and they do not share a key. Resolution therefore checks a more
specific name before falling back to the provider's.

Resolution order, most specific first:

1. an explicit `api_key=` passed to `Agent`/`hire()`/`model_map` - always wins,
   nothing here overrules what the caller stated
2. `model_map[rank]["key_env"]` - a variable name the config names outright,
   which is the escape hatch for anything the conventions below don't cover
3. `<ALIAS>_API_KEY`, where alias is `model_map[rank]["alias"]` - the name you
   give one endpoint ("openrouter", "together") when several share a provider
4. `<PROVIDER>_API_KEY` - the original behaviour, unchanged, so every existing
   config keeps working untouched

Nothing here ever logs a key. It logs *which source* a key came from, which is
the thing you actually need when the answer is "no key found" and you are sure
you set one.
