# `role` is RoleRank under a second, lowercase name - not a copy, the exact
# same class object - so a rank reads as `role.SENIOR` instead of
# `RoleRank.SENIOR`. This replaces an earlier attempt at this that bound
# C_SUITE/MANAGER/SENIOR/JUNIOR/INTERN/VOLUNTEER as bare top-level names:
# shorter to type, but MANAGER/SENIOR/JUNIOR/INTERN are common enough English
# words that `from llmadapt import *` (or even just picking a local variable
# name) could collide with one. Namespacing under one lowercase name cuts
# that risk from seven common words down to one - the same shape the standard
# library already uses for exactly this (`logging.INFO`, `logging.DEBUG`,
# `socket.AF_INET`, `errno.ENOENT`, `stat.S_IRUSR`): a short, lowercase
# module-like handle in front of the actual constants, instead of either the
# full class name or nothing in front of them at all.
#
# `role` is still a single common word, and this module's own org_templates.py
# uses `role` constantly as a *loop variable* (`for role in roles: ...`) - a
# local `role = ...` inside a function shadows the imported namespace for that
# function only, which is ordinary Python scoping and not a bug, but it means
# `role.SENIOR` won't resolve inside a block that's already reusing the name
# for something else. `RoleRank.SENIOR` remains available, unchanged, as the
# zero-ambiguity spelling for anyone who'd rather not have even that.
#
# `role` is deliberately NOT re-exported from the top-level `llmadapt`
# package - only `RoleRank` is, same as always. Getting `role` requires an
# explicit `from llmadapt.router import role` (or `from llmadapt.company
# import mode, review` for its two siblings below) rather than falling out of
# a bare `from llmadapt import *`. That trades one extra word in the import
# line for confining the collision risk to callers who deliberately opted in,
# rather than handing it to everyone who imports the package at all.
#
# Why this stays a plain class of string constants and not `class
# RoleRank(str, Enum)` (or 3.11+'s `StrEnum`, which pyproject.toml's
# `python_requires>=3.9` rules out outright): a real Enum CAN be made to
# behave exactly like a string everywhere - equality, hashing, dict-key use,
# and JSON serialization all already work correctly with a `str` mixin - but
# `f"{RoleRank.SENIOR}"` and `str(RoleRank.SENIOR)` do NOT come out as
# "SENIOR" by default; Enum's own `__str__`/`__format__` win over the mixin
# and print "RoleRank.SENIOR" instead (confirmed against a live interpreter,
# not assumed). Fixing that means remembering to add
# `__str__ = str.__str__` inside the class body - a one-line fix, but an easy
# one to forget, and this codebase embeds ranks into f-strings constantly
# (escalation messages, system-instruction role lines, error text) where the
# regression would be silent: a subtly wrong string handed to an LLM or
# printed in a log, not an exception. A plain class was already zero-risk on
# every one of those axes with no extra line required, and the typo-detection
# an Enum would add is already covered by `did_you_mean()` at validation time
# - so the extra machinery buys real but marginal safety at a real, easy-to-
# miss cost. Not worth it for a set of values this small and this static.
