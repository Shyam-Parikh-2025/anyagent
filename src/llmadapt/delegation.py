"""delegation.py - Phase 6: the two task-decomposition strategies.

Both live here rather than in two modules because they are the same idea at
different granularities - a more capable agent decides the *shape* of the work,
cheaper agents fill it in - and splitting them would invite two competing
decomposition systems, which is exactly what the roadmap warned against when
it folded "plan-then-execute" into this phase.

**stub-and-fill** - the architect emits a module of function signatures,
docstrings and type hints with empty bodies; implementers fill the bodies one
at a time; the results are reassembled into one module. Structured output, for
code.

**plan-then-execute** - the planner emits a numbered plan; each step is
executed in order, with earlier results available as context; an optional
synthesis pass turns the step results into one answer. Unstructured output,
for anything.

Reuse, not reinvention: `ContextCompressor.code_to_stub()` (compressor.py)
already turns real code into exactly the signature+docstring+`...` form the
architect is asked to produce. It is used here to normalize the architect's
output and to summarize already-written code as context, rather than writing a
second AST layer for the same job.

**Fixed by rank in v1.** Who architects and who implements comes from an
ordered rank preference list, not from a model deciding how deep to decompose.
The roadmap is explicit that dynamic decomposition depth is a research-adjacent
stretch goal with no clean formula - so this picks the most senior available
employee to architect and the cheapest available ones to implement, and says so
rather than pretending to be adaptive.

What this does NOT do, stated plainly:
- It does not execute or test the generated code. Assembly is checked with
  `compile()` for syntax only; a stub whose body is confidently wrong will
  assemble cleanly.
- It does not verify that an implementer honored the signature it was given.
  If the implementer renames the function, that stub is reported unfilled
  rather than silently mismatched, but a changed *parameter list* with the
  same name is accepted as-is.
- The planner's step list is parsed from prose with a numbered-list regex.
  Models are good at numbered lists and bad at guarantees; when nothing parses
  the whole task becomes a single step rather than failing.
