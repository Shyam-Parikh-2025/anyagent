"""help.py - one call that returns everything needed to build a company.

The problem this solves: the knowledge required to set up a `Company` was
spread across a tool schema (which arguments exist), `company_options()` (which
names are valid), four preset registries (what those names mean), and several
modules' docstrings (what the arguments actually *do* - what a budget of 0
means, what happens when nobody answers an escalation, which return value tells
you the run stopped). A model calling the setup tool could see the argument
list and nothing else, and a person had to read the source.

`company_help()` returns all of it as one structured document: the concepts,
every option with a description, the safety defaults spelled out rather than
implied, and worked examples. It is deliberately plain data - a dict, or
markdown via `company_help(as_text=True)` - so the same call serves a model
being handed context, a developer at a REPL, and a docs page.

It describes the library; it does not touch it. Calling this builds nothing,
spends nothing and changes nothing.
