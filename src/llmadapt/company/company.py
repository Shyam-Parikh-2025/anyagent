    because Company is where a caller sets the default and where an
    unrecognized one has to degrade safely.

    Reach for these through the `mode` alias below (`mode.AUTO`), the same

    behave like an ordinary string everywhere it travels (model_map/hire()
    keyword values, JSON, f-string-embedded log/error text), and a real Enum

            "cost_per_1k": ..., "alias": ..., "key_env": ...}.
            This is how a per-rank default model is set - {C_SUITE: {"provider":
            "anthropic", "model": "claude-opus-4-6"}, JUNIOR: {"provider":
            "ollama", "model": "llama3.1:8b"}} - and hire() overrides any of it
            for one employee.
            "api_key" is optional and usually better left out: with no key, the
            key is resolved from the environment (or a .env file) by
            env.resolve_api_key. "alias"/"key_env" steer that lookup for
            endpoints that share a provider but not an account - OpenRouter,
            Together and a local vLLM are all provider="openai" to the
            transport, and OPENAI_API_KEY is the wrong key for all of them.
            Per-rank defaults; hire() also takes a per-employee
            provider/model/api_key override for when the ranking-style default
            isn't what a specific employee should use.
            (Phase 4) "mode" is now acted on when a model_policy is attached:
            "local"/"api"/"auto" are handed to ModelPolicy.decide(), which
            consults benchmark.py/selector.py for the local side and its own
            cost/specialty catalog for the API side. Without a model_policy,
            "mode" is still inert and provider/model are taken literally, so
            existing configs behave exactly as before.
        log_compaction: an optional compaction.LogCompactionPolicy. When set
            (and not mode="off"), the activity/tool-call logs are compacted
            after every completed top-level task - the Phase 7 "keep broad
            concepts, drop specifics" pass. Left unset, the logs grow
            unbounded exactly as they did before Phase 7.
        presets: an optional presets.PresetBundle - the four named-preset
            registries (skills, personalities, palettes, org templates) this
            company resolves names against. Defaults to the shared built-in
            registries; pass `default_bundle().fork()` for a private copy that
            custom registrations won't leak out of.
        model_policy: an optional policy.ModelPolicy. When present, any rank
            or employee whose resolved mode is "local"/"api"/"auto" gets its
            provider/model chosen by the policy instead of read from
            model_map. An explicit provider+model (in model_map or at hire())
            always wins over the policy - the policy fills gaps, it doesn't
            override what you asked for.
        on_escalation: called once nothing automatic is left for EITHER
            escalation kind - the relevant reserve is empty, or a retry from
            it still failed. Must return an EscalationDecision. None (the
            default) falls back to escalation.default_on_escalation, which
            declines every escalation - the same "nobody's watching means
            stop" rule build_company()/set_company_up() already applied when
            no handler was given. This used to be a required argument, so
            every hand-written Company(...) call had to spell out a callback
            even for a throwaway example; the fallback keeps that same safe
            behavior without making you write it out. For prototyping on a
            local, no-spend model_map where auto-approving is genuinely
            harmless, escalation.always_approve(...) is a ready-made
            alternative - see its docstring for why it's named that bluntly.
        emergency_iteration_reserve: an integer reserve of *tool iterations*
            (a runaway-loop safety valve, unrelated to cost) drawn down
            automatically for tool_iteration_limit escalations before
            on_escalation is ever invoked. 0 means always ask a human first.
        total_token_budget: the company-wide hard ceiling on total real tokens
            spent (summed across every employee's Agent.total_tokens_used).
            None means unlimited - no budget gate runs at all. Once the
            company's cumulative spend reaches this ceiling, EVERY further
            request for more - internal reallocation included - must go
            through on_escalation; nothing silently crosses it. This is the
            "user stays at the top" cost-control default.
        emergency_budget_tokens: a real-token reserve drawn down automatically
            for budget_exhausted escalations, but ONLY while total spend is
            still below total_token_budget (see above) - once the hard
            ceiling itself is reached, this reserve is skipped too and
            on_escalation is always called. 0 means always ask a human first.
        rank_budget_shares: rank -> relative share of total_token_budget (see
            budget.DEFAULT_RANK_BUDGET_SHARES for the default table and
            budget.BudgetLedger for how a per-employee importance weight
            scales it). Only matters when total_token_budget is set.
        default_policy_mode: the routing mode every hire inherits when neither
            `hire(mode=...)` nor `model_map[rank]["mode"]` says otherwise -
            "auto", "local" or "api". None keeps the pre-existing behaviour
            exactly: no mode unless something names one, so the policy stays
            out of the way.

            `mode="local"`/`"api"` were always available per hire; what was
            missing was saying it once. "This whole company stays on local
            models" previously meant passing mode="local" to every single
            hire() call and remembering to do it for every future one - one
            omission and that employee silently starts spending money, which
            is the failure this whole layer exists to prevent. Precedence is
            narrowest-wins, as everywhere else here: hire(mode=) beats
            model_map[rank]["mode"] beats this.
        cost_weighted_budget: charge the budget in cost-equivalent tokens
            rather than raw ones, so a local employee's free tokens stop
            consuming the same ceiling as a frontier-API employee's. Off by
            default, because turning it on changes what the numbers in
            budget_report() mean and no existing config should shift under
            anyone. See budget.CostModel for where the prices come from - the
            Phase 4 decision, then model_map[rank]["cost_per_1k"], then the
            API catalog, then local detection.
        cost_model: a pre-built budget.CostModel, for full control over the
            baseline and the local/unknown weights. Supplying one implies
            cost_weighted_budget=True.
        archive: an optional archive.RunArchive. Every activity event and tool
            call is appended to it as it happens - before log_compaction can
            collapse anything - so the file stays the untouched record of the
            run even once the in-memory logs are rollups. None (the default)
            writes nothing anywhere. Hand the same RunArchive to an Agent to
            get the conversation transcript in the same file. Call finish()
            at the end to close it.

        policy.suggested_importance() for the explicit opt-in bridge and
        policy.py's module docstring for why they stay separate knobs.

        (Phase 5) skills/personality are names from this company's

        resolved) instead.

        Two distinct checks, in order:
        1. The company-wide hard ceiling (total_token_budget) - once total
           spend reaches it, nothing proceeds without on_escalation; internal
           reallocation can never cross this line, by design.
        2. This employee's own rank-based allocation - if it's used up,
           try borrowing slack from the reports_to chain (_try_reallocate)
           before escalating.

        The decision half is serialized by a company-wide lock, because both
        checks are read-then-act and the acting half changes shared state:
        _try_reallocate reads a manager's slack and then grants against it, and
        two employees gated at the same instant would otherwise each read the
        same slack and each be granted it.

        The lock is held across the *decision only*, never across the
        escalation that may follow it. That is deliberate and load-bearing: an
        approved escalation retries the employee's work, that work can delegate,
        and a delegation gates - so holding the lock across it would have the
        same task waiting on a lock it is already holding, which is a deadlock
        with no timeout and no error, just a company that stops. Hence the
        decision is a plain synchronous method with no awaits in it (which is
        also what makes it atomic here in the first place) and the escalation
        happens after the lock is released.

        The lock is *not* a fix for the wider check-then-charge gap - the charge
        only lands once the model has answered, so an employee can still pass a
        gate with room to spare and then overspend it. That was equally true
        before anything ran concurrently (nothing stops one employee passing
        with 1 token left and then spending 5000), and closing it properly needs
        a reservation rather than a lock; the company-wide ceiling in the first
        check remains the real backstop.
