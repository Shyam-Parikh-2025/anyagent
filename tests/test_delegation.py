# Phase 6 tests - delegation.py (stub-and-fill + plan-then-execute) and its
# Company.run_structured() entry point. Plain asserts + prints, no pytest, no
# network. Layers, bottom-up:
#   (1) pure parsing/assembly helpers - no agents involved at all
#   (2) rank-based architect/implementer selection
#   (3) stub_and_fill end to end against scripted agents, including the
#       failure modes (unparseable architect, implementer returning a stub)
#   (4) plan_then_execute, including a step that raises and a plan that
#       doesn't parse
#   (5) Company.run_structured dispatch
